      <h2>3D printing model</h2>

  <p>
   While I attended high school, the school purchased a 3D printer, and I was one of three students tasked with the assembly, the printer came with a couple of premade testing models but we had to make sure that the printer worked for other models as well.
   Because of that I made different testing models, one was a variation of an existing model with changed proportions while the other two were personally designed models.

	Models themselves were simple and made in an online CAD tool because the computers we had access to did not have the hardware needed to run Blender, therefore the models only consisted of simple shapes with no extrusions or any other tools that Blender
	offers. Still the models managed to be made without many problems and the printing process was a success.
