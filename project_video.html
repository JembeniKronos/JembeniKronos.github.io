      <h2>Football rules - 2D animation</h2>
      <div class="description-block">
  <p>
   During the course of Computer Animation we participated in a group project with a purpouse of making a 2D animation video using Blender. My teammate and I made a video about the rules of cards in football,
   the animation is short and simple using svg models as well as 3D blender models for the intro and outro of the animation.

  <p>
    The animation parts are made seperately and merged inside Adobe Premiere Pro, which also served as the means to record the voiceover for the video. As I had previous experience in this program the process was simple 
	and short, the biggest obstacle was the animation itself as Blender is not an optimized program for animating such as Illustrator or similar programs, while it does have the benefit of being able to work in a 3D environment 
	it's drawbacks significantlly outweigh it's advantages.
